                <div class="project-text">
                    <p style="padding: 0 20px;">The thesis is an evolution of an initial concept developed during the I3 (Iterdisciplinary/Integrated/Interactive) Project into a focused master's thesis. It presents a transformative approach to environmental parcel assessments, leveraging Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), particularly Geospatial Information Systems (GIS). By automating routine and repetitive tasks, the proposed software solution not only streamlines the assessment process but also significantly enhances the core functionalities of the platform. This includes improving the sophistication of analysis and the efficiency of generating comprehensive PDF reports. </p>
                    <p style="padding: 0 20px;">The software facilitiates user interaction, enabling specific controls such as controlling target parcel, map label position, map size, and the option to select between automated or manual summary inputs. This customization ensures that the reports are tailored to the specific environmental and regulatory requirements of each parcel. Moreover, the questionnaire is meticulously designed and implemented to ensure that it captures and addresses the expectations of the program's users effectively.</p>
                    <p style="padding: 0 20px;">Leveraging Python for efficient data retrieval, processing, analysis and visualization, the software provides lightweight access through cloud storage. It integrates narrative descriptions, charts, and maps to deliver insightful and actionable information about different environmental layers within and around a target parcel. By shifting to a streamlined approach, the software is expected to signiciantly reduce repetitive tasks. This transition should allow users to focus more on in-depth analysis and understanding of environmental conditions, enhancing decision-making processes in land use planning and management.</p>
                    <P STYLE="padding: 0 20px;"><strong>Due to the sensitive information integral to the development and findings of this project, acces to the thesis will be restricted for the first give years post-completion, safeguarding the methodologies and data involved. Further insights into the structure and content of the thesis will be provided here upon its completion.</strong></P>
