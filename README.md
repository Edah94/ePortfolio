# My Static Old ePorftolio Project

As part of the Applied Geoinformatics curriculum, students are required to create a portfolio prior to their thesis defense. As my focus within Geoinformatics lies in the realm of WebGIS, I chose to develop an HTML-based website to enhance my skills in the Web Stack (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and to deploy it online. This provides a platform for others to gain a clear overview of my professional and academic journey.

Building on this initial static website, a new version has emerged, made more dynamic and visually appealing through the generous efforts of a friend who selflessly contributed their time and expertise. Please feel free to explore my work to see how I approach creating and refining web pages, showcasing my growing capabilities in this domain.
